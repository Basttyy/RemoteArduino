# Libraries for ESP8266 WiFi module to interface with a connected Arduino Uno. 

## ArduinoOTAFirmwareUpdater
This library enables **OTA firmware update** function for ESP8266 to update the firmware on the connected Arduino through Serial communication. 
It receives the compiled binaries from a host machine through MQTT, then transmits the binaries to the Arduino. 

## ArduinoRemoteDebug
This library enables **remote debug log** from the connected Arduino through ESP8266. 

## ArduinoRemoteInterface
This library enables both the abovementioned functions with **OTA firmware update** having higher priority.
